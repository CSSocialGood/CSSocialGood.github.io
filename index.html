      <p>Founded in Fall 2018, NYU CS+Social Good was accepted into the TechShift Alliance, and attended their summit in January. We empower NYU’s network to leverage their skils by collaboratively taking action, through partnering with local
        organizations to make differences, and by exposing students to opportunities that make sustainable impacts. While other clubs foster an environment to hone computer science skills for specific groups, NYU CS+Social Good is a platform for
        anyone at NYU to make tangible impact on the community around us.

            Hi! I am a student from Hong Kong majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I get easily distracted by anything data-related, especially data
            {visualisation, science, engineering}. Computer Science fascinates me with its limitless
            applications across various domains, but its benefits seem unknown to many organisations and individuals, including my younger self!</p>

            As a senior pursuing a major in Honors Communications and a business minor, I have fostered my passion for the tech industry by spending all three summers of university scaling a high growth startup. Last year, I was thrilled to hear
            about CS+Social Good founding a chapter at NYU, where I now have the opportunity to pursue my interest in tech and social impact outside of work. At NYU, I am also captain of the NCAA D1 Fencing Team and a Leadership Program
            Coordinator for the Academic Affairs Office. With this team, I look forward to realizing our vision to make a difference here on campus, in NYC, and beyond!

            When I tell people I’m majoring in Computer Science and Social & Cultural Analysis, their reaction is usually “how do those fit together?” or “how did you come up with that?”. I think people have grown so accustomed to tech being
            attached to something negative, that they’ve overshadowed its ability to facilitate social change and propagate social good. CS + Social Good is my way of combating that stereotype, and using tech for good while helping others do the
            same. In my free time, I love learning obscure parts of songs on the piano, solving my miniature Rubik's Cube, and roaming through the stacks at The Strand.

            When I first heard that a new club called CS+Social Good was forming at NYU, I jumped at the chance to get involved. As someone who studies Computer Science with a minor in Sociology, I am always interested in approaching technology
            through a socially-conscious lens. I love leading the events team and putting together exciting and thought-provoking content for our members. Outside my time in school and as a part of this organization, I love dancing hip-hop and
            urban choreo, doing embroidery, and watching great tv shows.
